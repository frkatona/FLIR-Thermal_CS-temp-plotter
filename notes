for next time:
- read through Holman and note where relevant equations are
 - update powerpoint along the way
- pass over comprehensively for misunderstandings
- append/change any equations I misunderstood previously (e.g., convection that incorporates its previous temperature, power erf function, power with density or no?)
- strip away code until the axes of non-zero graphs make sense again

P slice too high when attenuation is low
Temp higher at bottom even when convection is high

modifiers to control weird distribution (especially conductivity to keep it low)
implementing heat capacity to q addition in T update
flipping the array (or finding where it gets flipped in RK4)

P_slice treated as power vs power density ~line 39 (maybe distribute after P_slice is found)
implement piece-wise nature of thermal conductivity contribution of cb content

changed heat capacity to be in m^3 instead of cm^3

current troubleshooting:
 - convection (top adiabaitic).  Also, top never gets actually hot so its convection isn't accurate
 - conductivity modifier outer = 0.001
- absorption modifier outer = 100
 - Nx = 20
 - flipping q before RK4

additional options: 


q currently in terms of W

current goal:
 - make sure q is just W (Holman p. 145)
 - be sure that the T update uses the volume of space correctly with q
